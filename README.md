# ECM1414 Data Structures and Algorithms Coursework

**A lift system that implements LOOK, SCAN and our own algorithm**  
Has options for Testing through text files or through random testing

## Installation

**Create a tests folder directory with test1-test6 folders within that. e.g:**  
_tests/test2_

**Dependencies**  
- Matplotlib

## Usage
**To run all tests (1-6):**  
_python LiftTesting.py random_

- Will produce graphs and an example input text file saved to tests/test{num}
- E.G Test 1 will save to tests/test1/


**To run an input file:**  
_python LiftTesting.py file [File Directory]_
- The input file will be executed by all 3 algorithms
- A bar chart will be generated with the results


# Features
- SCAN Algorithm
- LOOK Algorithm
- MyAlgorithm (Our own implementation)
- Graph Generation
- Testing through random input
- Testing through predetermined file inputs
- A queue that determines requests based on distance
